# SummaryApp

The purpose of this app is for users to paste text, a URL, or upload an image file and receive either a text summary or (in the case of an image file) text extraction. It is being developed using Streamlit and a number of Python libraries including NLTK. 

It is currently in Alpha.
The IMG page does not extract text.
The URL page works inconsistently. I recommended trying the following URLs for fun:
